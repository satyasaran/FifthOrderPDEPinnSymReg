## Abstract

This research introduces a mathematical and computational framework for studying the nonlinear propagation of waves in viscoelastic arterial blood flow, under assumptions of long wavelength and large Reynolds numbers. A **fifth-order nonlinear evolutionary equation**, derived through reductive perturbation theory, is used to model wave behavior in a viscoelastic tube, accounting for the tube wall's bending.

The following approaches were implemented:

1. **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs):**
   - Solved the governing PDEs across the spatial-temporal domain [-1, 1]x [0, 2].
   - Bayesian hyperparameter optimization was employed for improved model performance.
   - Achieved mean absolute residue error of O(10^{-3}).

2. **Machine Learning Integration:**
   - Solutions under three distinct initial conditions were merged using a random forest algorithm, achieving **99% accuracy** on the testing dataset.
   - The results were benchmarked against an artificial neural network (ANN).

3. **Symbolic Regression:**
   - Analytical solutions were derived using genetic programming for symbolic regression, resulting in interpretable models with a mean square error of \(O(10^{-3})\).

These methods offer new insights into modeling cardiovascular parameters and demonstrate the potential of integrating machine learning with symbolic regression for solving complex scientific problems.
